# Create service agreement document template

ServiceTitan provides a pre-designed service agreement template already set up with basic design elements and components that are ready for printing.

However, these templates are not editable. For example, you may want to customize your service agreement document to have the E-Sign feature by business unit.

To quickly start creating a service agreement template customized for your business, we recommend making a copy of a pre-designed template and customizing it to suit your branding and business requirements.

1. Go to the top toolbar and click Settings > Operations > Document Templates.
2. Search for the Service Agreement - ST Default template and click More > Duplicate.
3. On the Copy template screen that opens, enter a new Template name and leave the Template Type as Service Agreement.
4. When finished, click Duplicate.
5. From the Template Manager page, edit your content as needed:

   a. Edit the template details: The Template Details section lets you define the print settings of your invoice template, such as paper size, page margins, and more.

   b. Edit the template design: The Template Design section lets you add components to your invoice template. Components are placeholders that contain the elements essential to your invoice. For example, placing a Bill To component on the template means the Bill To customer appears on that area of the invoice you designated.

   c. Add E-Sign component: Drag the E-Sign component to add it to your Service Agreement Document Templates to deliver service agreement proposals electronically with an electronic signature link.

7. When finished, click Save and Publish.

# Customize E-Sign component

After you drag the E-Sign component and add it to the desired section of your Service Agreement document template, follow these steps to customize the E-Sign type from the Content window:

1. Sign Label: You can click Edit to customize the Sign label name. To hide a selection, click Show so it changes to Hide.

2. Choose the Signature Type: E-Sign offers four different field types. Click the Type dropdown to select one of the following options:

   a. Signature – The customer's full signature.

   b. Initials – The customer's initials.

   c. Date Signed – The date the Service Agreement was signed.

   d. Full Name – The customer's full name.

3. Use Multiple Components if Needed: Each E-Sign field must be added separately. If you need a Signature, Date signed, and Initials, you need to place three separate E-Sign components in the document.

# Create Service Agreement email template

Boost your brand by customizing your email templates with information specific to your business. To create a default email template for Service Agreement proposal emails, follow these steps:

1. Go to the top toolbar and click Settings.
2. In the side panel, go to Invoicing > Emails.
3. On the Email Settings screen that opens, click Service Agreements.
4. Add your company name and email in the Name and the Sender email fields under the From section.
5. (Optional) In the BCC field, enter the name and email address to which you want to send a blind carbon copy of the Service Agreement. Customers cannot see the BCC recipient in their email.
6. In the Subject field, enter a subject line for your email. For example, you can enter: "Your Service Agreement from [your company name]."
7. In the Body field, add placeholders for the information you want to show up on the email. Placeholders let you add customer-specific content to your templates. For example, start the email with "Hello {CustomerName}" and continue from there. When the email is sent, {CustomerName} is replaced by the full name of the customer. You can also:

   - Add a clickable link to your business, as well as your company logo, to the body of the email. If you use social media, add those links, too. For more, see HTML code.

   Note: The BCC field is not available for E-Sign email templates.

   Tip: If you want to know which Service Agreement you're referring to, add the {ServiceAgreementName} placeholder to the Subject field.

   - If you run multiple businesses, use the {BusinessUnitName} and {BusinessUnitPhoneNumber} placeholders in the statement email template to help your customers identify the company they did business with, in the statement email.

   - To add an electronic signature link to your email template, make sure to add {OnlineServiceAgreementLink} to the default email Body. This automatically includes the electronic signature link in future service agreement emails.

8. In the Preview section, check to ensure everything looks correct, and then click Save.

# Send Service Agreements with E-Sign component

When you customize the service agreement template to include the E-Sign component, the link appears anytime you send the SA email to a customer.

Note: Use these placeholders if each customer is assigned to only one business unit.

When the customer opens the email and clicks the agreement link, they are taken to the SA website, which displays all the details. Here, they can View and Sign Agreement.

After signing, the customer receives a copy of the signed agreement through email.

The service agreement now has the Accepted status. Change it to Activated to proceed.
